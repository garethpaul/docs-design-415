# Refresh Compatible JavaScript Dependencies

## Status: Planned

## Problem

The exact PR #15 lockfile is audit-clean and production-green, but a bounded
registry comparison reports four newer releases within the repository's
current major-version boundaries. Exact pins should absorb these compatible
upstream fixes while the focused editor, execute parser, and webpack `/docs`
build gates can still review the complete graph.

The available major upgrades for `@types/node` and TypeScript are separate
runtime and compiler compatibility decisions. They are intentionally excluded
from this narrow refresh.

## Priorities

1. P0: Preserve the zero-vulnerability, reproducible lockfile graph and the
   complete editor/execute production gate.
2. P1: Refresh the four compatible direct dependencies reported by the bounded
   registry check.
3. P1: Add a static contract that pins the reviewed versions and records the
   excluded major-version boundaries.

## Scope

- Update `@codemirror/search` from 6.7.0 to 6.7.1.
- Update `@radix-ui/react-menubar` from 1.1.17 to 1.1.18.
- Update `@radix-ui/react-navigation-menu` from 1.2.15 to 1.2.16.
- Update OpenAI from 6.42.0 to 6.44.0.
- Regenerate only `package-lock.json` through npm's structured package
  resolver.
- Preserve Node 20 compatibility, TypeScript 5.9, the patched esbuild 0.28.1
  resolution, editor language behavior, execute API behavior, workflow pins,
  and all existing stacked pull requests.

## Implementation Units

### U1: Refresh exact package pins

**Files:** `package.json`, `package-lock.json`

Install the four reviewed versions exactly and verify that transitive resolution
does not reintroduce the default-branch esbuild advisory.

### U2: Protect the dependency boundary

**Files:** `scripts/check-baseline.sh`, `CHANGES.md`, this plan

Add mutation-sensitive structured checks for all four exact pins, the patched
esbuild resolution, maintained change history, and truthful completed
verification evidence.

## Validation

- Run shell syntax, parser tests, TypeScript, the Next.js webpack production
  build including `/docs`, npm audit, and repository/external `make check`.
- Run the full gate on available Node 20, 22, and 24 runtimes.
- Reject isolated mutations to each direct package pin, one reviewed direct
  lockfile resolution, the esbuild lockfile resolution, plan status, and
  verification evidence.
- Audit the exact diff, generated artifacts, untracked files, credentials,
  conflict markers, binaries, file modes, and whitespace before committing.

## Risks

- Compatible releases can still contain behavioral changes; type-check,
  parser, webpack build, and audit gates must all pass on the reviewed graph.
- The OpenAI SDK is exercised through compile-time and route-level tests only;
  no live provider request is made.
- TypeScript 6 and `@types/node` 25 remain intentionally deferred because they
  cross compiler or supported-runtime boundaries.
- This change is stacked on PR #15, which must remain open and merge first.
