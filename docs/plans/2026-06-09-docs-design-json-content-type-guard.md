title: Docs Design JSON Content-Type Guard
date: 2026-06-09
status: completed
execution: code

## Context

The design prototype execute API validated method, body shape, and static chat
completion parameters, but did not explicitly require JSON content types before
processing submitted code.

## Goals

- Reject non-JSON execute API requests with a clear client error.
- Accept standard JSON content types with optional parameters such as
  `charset=utf-8`.
- Cover the content-type helper with deterministic parser/helper tests.
- Keep the guard documented in the README and preserved by the baseline script.

## Verification

- `npm run test:parser`
- `scripts/check-baseline.sh`
- `make check`
- `git diff --check`
