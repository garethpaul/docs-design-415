# Docs Design Integration Verification Matrix

## Status: In Progress

## Problem Frame

Portable checks cover execute parsing, validation, provider-call bounds,
response caching, request budgeting, responsive source contracts, and package
builds. The repository does not define repeatable exact-head evidence for the
responsive editor-to-route flow, deployment configuration, or provider
responses.

## Scope Boundaries

- Do not change route, workspace, editor, parser, responsive layout,
  dependency, authentication, rate-limit, configuration, or deployment
  behavior.
- Do not add API keys, authorization values, submitted code, provider output,
  cookies, account identifiers, screenshots, or logs.
- Do not claim browser, deployed route, or live OpenAI execution from portable
  parser, build, static, or package checks.
- Do not merge or close stacked pull requests without explicit authorization.

## Requirements

- R1. Add an exact-commit matrix for deployment interlock, responsive editor
  submission, route validation, no-store responses, request budgeting,
  provider success, provider failure, timeout handling, and browser refresh.
- R2. Require isolated synthetic requests and sanitized evidence fields with
  explicit `pass`, `fail`, `blocked`, or `not run` status.
- R3. Keep portable package checks, local route tests, responsive browser
  evidence, deployment evidence, and live provider evidence separate.
- R4. Add mutation-sensitive contracts for the matrix, project guidance, and
  completed plan evidence.

## Implementation

1. Add the integration matrix with all scenarios marked `not run`.
2. Link the matrix from project guidance and record the evidence boundary.
3. Extend the deterministic checker with scenario, status, and plan contracts.
4. Run focused, full, external-directory, audit, and hostile mutation gates.

## Verification

- `sh -n scripts/check-baseline.sh`
- `make check` from repository and external working directories
- Node.js 20 and 24 pinned package gates
- `npm audit --audit-level=moderate`
- Isolated hostile documentation mutations
- Exact diff, generated-artifact, and secret-pattern audits
